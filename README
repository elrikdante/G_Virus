G Virus

Does your app use Resque for background tasks?  It sucks having to click retry a thousand times because of api Timeout errors, database race conditions, etc.  

Introducting, the G Virus.  Giving your failed jobs, new life >=D

Usage:
/app/jobs/email_sender.rb
class EmailSenderQueue
  # The queue is now infected
  include G_Virus
  class << self
    def perform(option={})
      # send an email
    end
  end
end
